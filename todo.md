This is a helper prompt to use in Claude.ai to help made the editor:

```md
I'm going to send you a single HTML file containing a web application. This application is a tile-based editor with various interactive features. After I send the code, please analyze it and be prepared to:

1. Explain the main features and functionality of the application.
2. Suggest improvements or additional features that could enhance the user experience.
3. Help with debugging or optimizing specific parts of the code.
4. Implement new features or modify existing ones as requested.
   When responding, please:
   - Provide concise explanations and code snippets rather than full file contents.
   - Use markdown for code formatting.
   - Focus on the specific areas or features I ask about.
   - Offer step-by-step instructions for implementing changes when needed.

I'll begin by sending the entire HTML file in my next message. After that, we can discuss various aspects of the code and work on improving the application.
Note: make sure you read all the code before starting to work on it.
```
